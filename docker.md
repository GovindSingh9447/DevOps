### Storing credentials directly in a Dockerfile is not recommended due to security concerns, as Dockerfiles are often shared and versioned, potentially exposing sensitive information.

A better approach is to use environment variables to pass credentials securely to your Python project running inside the Docker container. Here's how you can do it:

## 1.Using Environment Variables:

In your Dockerfile, you can use the ENV instruction to set environment variables. You can then access these variables from your Python code.

```
FROM python:3.9

# Set environment variables for credentials
ENV USERNAME=myusername
ENV PASSWORD=mypassword

# Copy your Python project files into the container
COPY . /app

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run your Python script
CMD ["python", "your_script.py"]
```
In your Python code, you can access these environment variables using os.environ:

```
import os

username = os.environ.get('USERNAME')
password = os.environ.get('PASSWORD')

# Use username and password in your code
```

## 2 Using Docker Secrets (for more sensitive data):

Docker secrets are more suitable for highly sensitive information like passwords, API keys, or certificates. Here's how you can use Docker secrets:

First, create a Docker secret:

```
echo "mypassword" | docker secret create my_password -
```
